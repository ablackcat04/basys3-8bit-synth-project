# Basys3 8-Bit Synth Project

This repository contains part of my final project for a course, featuring a simple 8-bit synthesizer designed for the Basys3 FPGA board by Digilent.

## Project Overview
The synthesizer implements basic waveforms:
- **Pulse** and **Triangle** waveforms: Functioning as intended.
- **Noise waveform**: Untuned and experimental.
- 4 Channel Mixer: sw[3:0] controls whether the channel is opened or not.
- AD envelope generator: Curently only applies to noise.

The project does not include any kind of score reader or advanced features, as it is a simplified design.

### Status
This project is **deprecated** since the semester has ended, and I no longer have access to the Basys3 board.

### Logic Diagram

## Notes
This project represents an educational exploration of audio synthesis on an FPGA. It is not a fully polished or complete synthesizer.
